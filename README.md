a personal implementation of Flow Ground Video Prediction

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09755
(full title: Flow-Grounded Spatial-Temporal Video Prediction from Still Images)

This is an implementation of paper above using pytorch1.8.0, based on the Lua language version codes implemented by https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/FlowGrounded-VideoPrediction. And by now it's not a perfect implementation though it can be ran on PyCharm.

Dataset used here is Scene FLow Driving(only use a small part for testing), you can refer to home page of SceneFlowDatasets for more details(https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html#downloads).

(note: train_flow2rgb.py and evaluate have two version, and file with suffix '_1' are the newest version.)
